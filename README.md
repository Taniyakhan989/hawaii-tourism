# Hawaii Tourism
A website to promote tourism in Hawaii, made for an assignment by [KIMO](https://kimo.ai/). I haven't worked with Typescript before, but did my best to look up key concepts and implement this project using it. All API calls are made using an API controller that is structured to easily support multiple API versions. Data fetching is done on the server side, and the pages use SSR for all information. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
